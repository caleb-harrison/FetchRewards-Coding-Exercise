## üó£Ô∏è Developer Notes

This coding exercise brought me a lot of joy and I appreciate the challenge! I learned a few things along the way and drilled many skills deeper into my existing skillset.

The API brought me a few challenges that I was able to overcome such as:
- Backwards compatability prior to iOS 13
- Fetching recommended events from API based on user's location and a favorited event
- Fetching images from API


Although these challenges were something I hadn't done before, I was quickly able to break down what I wanted to accomplish, do research, and eventually implement the solution. 

**This project, among others in the last 6-8 months, have highlighted to me that iOS app development is what I love to do and what best encapsulates my skillset. I have tried many types of software development and explored other computer science options and mobile application development‚Äìspecifically iOS app development‚Äìbrings together all of my favorite portions of development. Mobile app development allows me to constantly show my eye for design while also being able to solve real-world problems and see them unfold before my eyes as I progress.**

**Working for a company such as Fetch Rewards while being able to do what I love would be a dream come true.
I hope that my passion can be conveyed in my work here and potentially further in a future conversation! Thank you so much for taking the time to review my submission.**
